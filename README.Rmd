The goal of quickr is to make your R code run quicker.

## Overview

R is an extremely flexible and dynamic language, but that flexibility
and dynamicism can come at the expense of speed. This package lets you
trade back some of that flexibility for some speed, for the context of a
single function.

<!-- Programming language design requires some hard decisions and trade-ofs. -->

<!-- When you want to have it all, you typically end up have two (or more!) languages. -->

<!-- An interpreted, dynamic language full of conveniences, and a staticly-typed, explicit, high-performance language. -->

<!-- This is sometimes called the "Two Language Problem". -->

<!-- Like [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) in Python, or the [Julia](https://julialang.org) language, quickr is a solution to the [two-language problem](https://juliadatascience.io/julia_accomplish). -->

<!-- Unlike those tools however, quickr does not bundle most of LLVM, keeping dependencies lightweight. -->

<!-- Quickr works by translating the R code to Fortran. -->

<!-- Fortran might seem like a surprising choice, but it has many compelling properties: -->

<!-- -   Superb performance. -->

<!--     As a stalwart of the numerical computing community, Fortran has accrued the benefit of countless person-hours from top-tier computer scientists and compiler engineers. -->

<!--     There is a reason that over 20% of R itself, (and numpy, and ...) are still in Fortran, and it's not merely because of legacy. -->

<!--     And this trend of compiler engineers focusing on Fortran is not stopping. -->

<!-- -   Large overlap with R semantics and syntax for numerical computing. -->

<!--     Fortran and R have very similar syntax for operating on arrays. -->

<!--     Like R, Fortran has builtin-in support for nd-arrays, provides vectorized operators on arrays, convenient array slicing semantics that match many capabilities of R's `[` , 1-based indexing, and a well-populated collection of operators for working on those arrays like `min`, `max`, `any` `all`, etc. -->

<!--     This means that it's relatively straightforward to translate R to Fortran, often just a 1:1 mapping of semantics, with some changes to syntax. -->

<!--     This is also why Fortran has such superb performance, and why it attracts compiler engineers to work on it. -->

<!--     Because the language spec guarantees things like, static shapes for nd-arrays, views of those arrays, etc, it provides many opportunities for compiler engineers to do things like generate SIMD instructions, or automatically parallelize code. -->

<!-- -   Excellent support in R. -->

<!--     One of the original motivations for R was to serve as a front-end for Fortran. -->

<!--     Since its inception, R has supported Fortran extensions, and supported them well. -->

<!--     It also means that any computing environment where R build tools are available, Fortran is supported. -->

<!--     The barrier to entry and thorny questions, that, for example, using Rust in CRAN might raise, is non-existent for Fortran. -->

The main exported function is `quick()`. Here is how you use it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(quickr)

convolve <- quick(function(a, b) {
  declare(type(a = double(NA)),
          type(b = double(NA)))
  ab <- double(length(a) + length(b) - 1)
  for (i in seq_along(a)) {
    for (j in seq_along(b)) {
      ab[i+j-1] <- ab[i+j-1] + a[i] * b[j]
    }
  }
  ab
})
```

`quick()` returns a quicker R function. How much quicker? Let's
benchmark it! For reference, we'll also compare it to a
[pure-C](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-exts.html#Calling-_002eCall-1)
implementation.

```{r, message = FALSE, fig.width=10}
slow_convolve <- function(a, b) {
  declare(type(a = double(NA)),
          type(b = double(NA)))
  ab <- double(length(a) + length(b) - 1)
  for (i in seq_along(a)) {
    for (j in seq_along(b)) {
      ab[i+j-1] <- ab[i+j-1] + a[i] * b[j]
    }
  }
  ab
}

library(quickr)
quick_convolve <- quick(slow_convolve)

convolve_c <- inline::cfunction(
  sig = c(a = "SEXP", b = "SEXP"), body = r"({
    int na, nb, nab;
    double *xa, *xb, *xab;
    SEXP ab;

    a = PROTECT(Rf_coerceVector(a, REALSXP));
    b = PROTECT(Rf_coerceVector(b, REALSXP));
    na = Rf_length(a); nb = Rf_length(b); nab = na + nb - 1;
    ab = PROTECT(Rf_allocVector(REALSXP, nab));
    xa = REAL(a); xb = REAL(b); xab = REAL(ab);
    for(int i = 0; i < nab; i++) xab[i] = 0.0;
    for(int i = 0; i < na; i++)
        for(int j = 0; j < nb; j++)
            xab[i + j] += xa[i] * xb[j];
    UNPROTECT(3);
    return ab;
})")



a <- runif(100000); b <- runif(100)

timings <- bench::mark(
  r = slow_convolve(a, b),
  quickr = quick_convolve(a, b),
  c = convolve_c(a, b),
  min_time = 2
)
timings
plot(timings) + bench::scale_x_bench_time(base = NULL)
```

In the case of `convolve()`, `quick()` returns a function approximately
*200* times quicker, with performance similar to the C function.

`quick()` can accelerate any R function, with some restrictions:

-   Function arguments must have their types and shapes declared using
    `declare()`.
-   Only atomic vectors, matrices, and array are currently supported:
    `integer`, `double`, `logical`, and `complex`.
-   The return value must be an atomic array (e.g., not a list)
-   Named variables must have consistent shapes throughout their
    lifetimes.
-   `NA` values are not supported.
-   Only a subset of R's vocabulary is currently supported.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
quickr:::r2f_handlers |> names() |>
  (\(x) x[order(grepl("^[a-z]", x), grepl("^[A-Z]", x), x)])() |>
  noquote()
```

Many of these restrictions are expected to be relaxed as the project
matures. However, quickr is intended primarily for high-performance
numerical computing, so features like polymorphic dispatch or support
for complex or dynamic types are out of scope.

## `declare(type())` syntax:

The shape and mode of all function arguments must be declared. Local and
return variables may optionally also be declared.

`declare(type())` also has support for declaring size constraints, or
size relationships between variables. Here are some examples of declare
calls:

```{r}
declare(type(x = double(NA))) # x is a 1-d double vector of any length
declare(type(x = double(10))) # x is a 1-d double vector of length 10
declare(type(x = double(1)))  # x is a scalar double

declare(type(x = integer(2, 3)))  # x is a 2-d integer matrix with dim (2, 3)
declare(type(x = integer(NA, 3))) # x is a 2-d integer matrix with dim (<any>, 3)

# x is a 4-d logical matrix with dim (<any>, 24, 24, 3)
declare(type(x = logical(NA, 24, 24, 3)))

# x and y are 1-d double vectors of any length
declare(type(x = double(NA)),
        type(y = double(NA)))

# x and y are 1-d double vectors of the same length
declare(
  type(x = double(n)),
  type(y = double(n)),
)

# x and y are 1-d double vectors, where length(y) == length(x) + 2
declare(type(x = double(n)),
        type(y = double(n+2)))
```

Tip: declare shapes as specifically as you can. quickr uses these size
constraints both for compile-time checking and for choosing more
efficient implementations. For example, if you know a matrix is square,
declare it as `type(A = double(n, n))` (not `double(n, k)`). That can
allow quickr to use a faster code path for operations like
`solve(A, b)`. If the compiler can't prove a matrix is square, it may
need to fall back to a more general rectangular solver.

## More examples:

### `viterbi`

The Viterbi algorithm is an example of a dynamic programming algorithm
within the family of Hidden Markov Models
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm>). Here, `quick()`
makes `viterbi()` approximately 50 times faster.

```{r}
slow_viterbi <- function(observations, states, initial_probs, transition_probs, emission_probs) {
    declare(
      type(observations = integer(num_steps)),
      type(states = integer(num_states)),
      type(initial_probs = double(num_states)),
      type(transition_probs = double(num_states, num_states)),
      type(emission_probs = double(num_states, num_obs)),
    )

    trellis <- matrix(0, nrow = length(states), ncol = length(observations))
    backpointer <- matrix(0L, nrow = length(states), ncol = length(observations))
    trellis[, 1] <- initial_probs * emission_probs[, observations[1]]

    for (step in 2:length(observations)) {
      for (current_state in 1:length(states)) {
        probabilities <- trellis[, step - 1] * transition_probs[, current_state]
        trellis[current_state, step] <- max(probabilities) * emission_probs[current_state, observations[step]]
        backpointer[current_state, step] <- which.max(probabilities)
      }
    }

    path <- integer(length(observations))
    path[length(observations)] <- which.max(trellis[, length(observations)])
    for (step in seq(length(observations) - 1, 1)) {
      path[step] <- backpointer[path[step + 1], step + 1]
    }

    out <- states[path]
    out
}

quick_viterbi <- quick(slow_viterbi)

set.seed(1234)
num_steps <- 16
num_states <- 8
num_obs <- 16

observations <- sample(1:num_obs, num_steps, replace = TRUE)
states <- 1:num_states
initial_probs <- runif (num_states)
initial_probs <- initial_probs / sum(initial_probs)  # normalize to sum to 1
transition_probs <- matrix(runif (num_states * num_states), nrow = num_states)
transition_probs <- transition_probs / rowSums(transition_probs)  # normalize rows
emission_probs <- matrix(runif (num_states * num_obs), nrow = num_states)
emission_probs <- emission_probs / rowSums(emission_probs)  # normalize rows

timings <- bench::mark(
  slow_viterbi = slow_viterbi(observations, states, initial_probs,
                              transition_probs, emission_probs),
  quick_viterbi = quick_viterbi(observations, states, initial_probs,
                                transition_probs, emission_probs)
)
timings
plot(timings)
```

### Diffusion simulation

Simulate how heat spreads over time across a 2D grid, using the [finite
difference method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference)
applied to the [Heat
Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation).

Note the use of local closures within the quick function. Here,
`quick()` returns a function approximately 20 times faster. The speedup
is relatively modest because the core operation of computing the
laplacian is already expressed as a vectorized operation. If we were
instead comparing against `for` loops that operate on individual array
elements, the speedup would be much more substantial. In general,
idiomatic vectorized R code is quite fast already!

```{r}
diffuse_heat <- function(nx, ny, dx, dy, dt, k, steps) {
  declare(
    type(nx = integer(1)),
    type(ny = integer(1)),
    type(dx = integer(1)),
    type(dy = integer(1)),
    type(dt = double(1)),
    type(k = double(1)),
    type(steps = integer(1))
  )

  temp <- matrix(0, nx, ny)
  temp[nx %/% 2L, ny %/% 2L] <- 100

  apply_boundary_conditions <- function(temp) {
    temp[1, ] <- 0
    temp[nx, ] <- 0
    temp[, 1] <- 0
    temp[, ny] <- 0
    temp
  }

  update_temperature <- function(temp) {
    temp_new <- temp

    i <- 2:(nx - 1)
    j <- 2:(ny - 1)

    laplacian <-
      (temp[i + 1, j] - 2 * temp[i, j] + temp[i - 1, j]) / dx ^ 2 +
      (temp[i, j + 1] - 2 * temp[i, j] + temp[i, j - 1]) / dy ^ 2

    temp_new[i, j] <- temp[i, j] + k * dt * laplacian
    temp_new
  }

  for (step in seq_len(steps)) {
    temp <- temp |>
      apply_boundary_conditions() |>
      update_temperature()
  }

  temp
}


quick_diffuse_heat <- quick(diffuse_heat)

# Parameters
nx <- 100L      # Grid size in x
ny <- 100L      # Grid size in y
dx <- 1L        # Grid spacing
dy <- 1L        # Grid spacing
dt <- 0.01      # Time step
k <- 0.1        # Thermal diffusivity
steps <- 500L   # Number of time steps

timings <- bench::mark(
  diffuse_heat = diffuse_heat(nx, ny, dx, dy, dt, k, steps),
  quick_diffuse_heat = quick_diffuse_heat(nx, ny, dx, dy, dt, k, steps)
)
summary(timings, relative = TRUE)
plot(timings)
```

### Rolling Mean

Here is *quickr* used to calculate a rolling mean. The CRAN package
*RcppRoll* already provides a highly optimized rolling mean, which we
include in the benchmarks for comparison.

```{r}
slow_roll_mean <- function(x, weights, normalize = TRUE) {
  declare(
    type(x = double(NA)),
    type(weights = double(NA)),
    type(normalize = logical(1))
  )
  out <- double(length(x) - length(weights) + 1)
  n <- length(weights)
  if (normalize)
    weights <- weights/sum(weights)*length(weights)

  for(i in seq_along(out)) {
    out[i] <- sum(x[i:(i+n-1)] * weights) / length(weights)
  }
  out
}

quick_roll_mean <- quick(slow_roll_mean)

x <- dnorm(seq(-3, 3, len = 100000))
weights <- dnorm(seq(-1, 1, len = 100))

timings <- bench::mark(
  r = slow_roll_mean(x, weights),
  rcpp = RcppRoll::roll_mean(x, weights = weights),
  quickr = quick_roll_mean(x, weights = weights)
)
timings

timings$expression <- factor(names(timings$expression), rev(names(timings$expression)))
plot(timings) + bench::scale_x_bench_time(base = NULL)
```

## Linear regression benchmark (`fastLm`)

quickr supports a variety of matrix operations from base R, including
most of the common linear algebra functions like `%*%`, `crossprod()`,
`tcrossprod()`, `solve()`, and `chol()`. Performance is generally
similar to running the same code in R itself, but as you start to chain
multiple operations in a function, you may see speed-ups due to reduced
interpreter overhead. Actual performance depends on the BLAS/LAPACK
libraries linked to your R build (e.g. OpenBLAS, MKL, Accelerate).

To illustrate, here is a benchmark showing a `fastLm`-style
implementation comparing base R, quickr, and (for reference) a compiled
RcppArmadillo implementation. The `fastLm` function is adapted from the
README of the RcppArmadillo project.

```{r}
fast_lm <- function(X, y) {
  declare(
    type(X = double(n, k)),
    type(y = double(n))
  )

  n <- nrow(X)
  k <- ncol(X)
  df_residual <- n - k

  coef <- qr.solve(X, y)     # fit model y ~ X
  res <- y - X %*% coef      # residuals
  s2 <- sum(res * res) / df_residual

  XtX <- crossprod(X)
  XtX_inv <- qr.solve(XtX, diag(k))
  std_err <- sqrt(s2 * diag(XtX_inv))

  list(
    coefficients = coef,
    stderr       = std_err,
    df.residual  = df_residual
  )
}

quick_fast_lm <- quick(fast_lm)

Rcpp::sourceCpp(
code = '
#include <RcppArmadillo/Lighter>
// [[Rcpp::depends(RcppArmadillo)]]

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::List rcpp_armadillo_fast_lm(const arma::mat& X, const arma::colvec& y) {
    int n = X.n_rows, k = X.n_cols;

    arma::colvec coef = arma::solve(X, y);     // fit model y ~ X
    arma::colvec res  = y - X*coef;            // residuals
    double s2 = arma::dot(res, res) / (n - k); // std.errors of coefficients
    arma::colvec std_err = arma::sqrt(s2 * arma::diagvec(arma::pinv(arma::trans(X)*X)));

    return Rcpp::List::create(Rcpp::Named("coefficients") = coef,
                              Rcpp::Named("stderr")       = std_err,
                              Rcpp::Named("df.residual")  = n - k);
}')
```

### Benchmark

```{r}
set.seed(1)

beta <- c(0.5, 1.0, -2.0, 10, 5)
X <- cbind(1, matrix(rnorm(3 * 10^5), ncol = 4))
y <- as.vector(X %*% beta + rnorm(nrow(X), sd = 2))

timings <- bench::mark(
  R = fast_lm(X, y),
  quickr = quick_fast_lm(X, y),
  RcppArmadillo = rcpp_armadillo_fast_lm(X, y)
)

timings
plot(timings)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parallelize loops with OpenMP

Use `declare(parallel())` to annotate the next `for` loop or `sapply()`
call for OpenMP parallelization. Parallel loops must be
order-independent: avoid shared-state updates or inter-iteration
dependencies. OpenMP adds overhead, so it can be slower for small
workloads, but substantially faster for larger ones.

Here is a concrete example using `colSums()`. At smaller sizes, the
quickr serial version is fastest (even faster than base `colSums()`). As
sizes grow, the two serial versions converge, and the parallel version
pulls ahead. However, the speedup is not linear with core count (e.g.,
with 12 cores, the speedup is closer to \~6x).

```{r}
colSums_quick_parallel <- quick(function(x) {
  declare(type(x = double(NA, NA)))
  declare(parallel())
  sapply(seq_len(nrow(x)), \(r) sum(x[, r]))
})

colSums_quick <- quick(function(x) {
  declare(type(x = double(NA, NA)))
  sapply(seq_len(nrow(x)), \(r) sum(x[, r]))
})

r <- bench::press(
  n = 2^(4:14),
  {
    m <- array(runif(n * n), c(n, n))
    bench::mark(
      parallel = colSums_quick_parallel(m),
      quick = colSums_quick(m),
      base = colSums(m),
    )
  },
  .quiet = TRUE
)

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

r |>
  mutate(.before = 1,
         desc = attr(expression, "description")) |>
  select(desc, n, median) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = median, color = desc)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  scale_x_log10() + bench::scale_y_bench_time()
```

quickr does not set OpenMP thread counts. To control threads, set
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` (and optionally `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT` or `OMP_DYNAMIC`)
before calling a compiled function, e.g.
`Sys.setenv(OMP_NUM_THREADS = "4")`.

## Using `quickr` in an R package

When called in a package, `quick()` will pre-compile the quick functions
and place them in the `./src` directory. Run `devtools::load_all()` or
`quickr::compile_package()` to ensure that the generated files in
`./src` and `./R` are in sync with each other.

In a package, you must provide a function name to `quick()`. For
example:

``` r
my_fun <- quick(name = "my_fun", function(x) ....)
```

## Installation

You can install quickr from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("quickr")
```

You can install the development version of quickr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("t-kalinowski/quickr")
```

You will also need a C and Fortran compiler, preferably the same ones
used to build R itself.

On macOS:

-   Make sure xcode tools and gfortran are installed, as described in
    <https://mac.r-project.org/tools/>. In Terminal, run:

    ``` zsh
    sudo xcode-select --install
    # curl -LO https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg # R 4.4
    # sudo installer -pkg gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg -target /
    curl -LO https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-14.2-universal.pkg   # R 4.5
    sudo installer -pkg gfortran-14.2-universal.pkg -target /
    ```

-   Optional: install `flang-new` via Homebrew (used by quickr on macOS
    when available):

    ``` zsh
    brew install flang
    ```

On Windows:

-   Install the latest version of
    [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)

On Linux:

-   The "Install Required Dependencies" section
    [here](https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r-source.html#install-required-dependencies)
    provides detailed instructions for installing R build tools on
    various Linux flavors.
